YUNUS EMRE II

(Continued from last issue)

By Bülent Ecevit

An even more impressive example of the humanistic elemant in Yunus Emre, the thirteenth century folk poet, is his "News from the Land of Hell". In this poem, his compassion for humanity seems to predomitave his relitigious feelings:

If you ask for news of the land of hell 
They burn and burn and weep 
For the great prophet of religion 
They hope and hope and weep.

Burning burning they turn into coal 
Gone to the depth of hell their soul 
Thousands of years they stay in hell 
They bum and burn weep.

The impious stand tortures dire 
A burning air they all respire 
On their necks are chains of fire 
They bear and bear and weep.

Find a remedy for this pain, Yunus says, 
Go to the Prophet pray for their case 
Vast is God’s ocean of grace 
They hope and hope and weep.

In the voice of the water-wheel, Yunus Emre puts into words the nostalgia of the true mystic.

Why do you wail O water-wheel 
Sorrowful I am so I wail 
I have fallen in love with God 
This is the reason that I wail.

I’m the sorrowful wheel they say 
Sparkling my water flows away 
God, has ordained it in this way 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.

They found me on a mountain there 
Of limbs and wings they stripped me bare 
And so this fate I have to bear 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.

I am the tree of a mountain high 
I am not sweet nor sour am I 
My Lord I humbly thank and pray 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.

From the mountain I was unset 
All my order has been upset 
I am an unfailing poet 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.

One can’t attain the heart’s desire 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.
None can endure this wailing dire 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.

From below my water I draw 
Then higher this water I pour 
Come and see what I suffer so 
By their carpenters I was hewn.

Yunus one does not smile in here 
All my parts have been set in tune 
This wailing came to me from God 
Sorrowful I am so I wail.

Note for correction: In introduction to Yunus Emre's poetry in our last issue, the word "subjective" (first paragraph, line four), should be "objective".
