AMERICAN HANDCRAFTS
By Bülent ECEVÝT
   Those who have migrated to America, this land of pioneers, must have had at least one com- mon characteristic, - they were ali prepared to cut off their ties with their native lands and their traditions.
   Yet folk arts are rooted deep iýu|p> the soil of individual coun- tries or regions and closely rela- ted to traditions.
   Therefore, it could not have been expected of men who could break away with their traditions to continue the folk arts of their native lands, vvhile engaged in a hard struggle for existence un- der different conditions of life in an overseas country.
   However, a new folk art was bound to evolve with the emer- gencft' in time, of a homogenous nation.
.
   Obviouslv, the new comers vvere little, if aoall, influenced by the natives of America; so, this new folk art could hardly be expected to have anything in common with the art of the Indians.
   The American of to-day, has a tendency for simplicity and cla- rity of lines, in the fields of pain- ting, industry, architecture, fur- niture, and clothing,—with the ex- ception of those fancy neckties and shirts.
   The over-crowded patterns of the folk arts of most countries have become scarcer in America and the objects and animals that had been developed, through centuries, into stylized symbols, have become abstract forms.
   The ultimate aim of colour harmony, in American handi- crafts, seems to be the arrange- ment of large patterýfof colour in the most refreshing way; and, vvhat are sought in linear harmony are the most concise modes of ex- pression.
   The folk art of the United States, as far as one can judge from the current exhibition of American Handicrafts at the Faculty of Let- ters in Ankara, is characterized by a search for the simplest formulas of proportion between colours, lines and forms.
   The attemps at standardizing handicrafts through community  projects, in America, seems to have expedited, even if in an ar- tifical way, the development of these works into a folk art.
