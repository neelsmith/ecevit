HASAN KAPTAN
By our art Editor BÜLEND ECEVÝT
; The “HELIKON” Art Society, recently - founded in i Ankara with the purpose of following and pro1- pogating' - contemporary art movements - through the media of exhibitions, t cinema shows, concepts and-- lectures, has opened its Gallery,-'-: at 25 Mithat ?:	Paga
Street, Yenigehir, - with an exhibition by the 10 years- old: Turkish artist Hasan- Kaptan, who already enflqys- sf upiversal repiftation.
   This is/ Hasan’s £orutjh exhibition . in Turkey. He has been painting, for the last four years. He .alsp had succesful exhibitions in Paris, and, recently,, in -New York- He will soon have another one in- Mexico.,-
      The art critiques in Europe and . America have either recognized a precocious talent in him, or, going even further them that, have . regarded him as a mature)	tip|/r whose, ag)& rCcpJd no
more be .jt ,ayy ’ffw
   Every time I have seen Ha- sap’s, new pictures, since he ytas eight., years /old#] If have Jbjpen finding it hard to expect" any further progress from this Child artist. Yet' Hasan " has always given the best proof to" the fact that there can be no limits either for Man of for JCrt, In every new thfit' he did, i lihvefourid Hasan beyond the limit ’-that my power of imagination had drafoii.
   The Subject of tiiiidren’s "painting has recently been taken into hand- under a new light by Educationalists, psychologists and aestheticians, allmost everywhere In the World, and the art education of children in comparatively progressive schools has been given a hew direction-; The results of this new impetus khow certain common "characteristics in children’s painting.	-
   ¥et these characteristics eann'bt bh'found tii Hasaii Kaptan^ work. Some of them rtiight have existed in his earlier paintings,1 but how, -thby do hot exist at afl.	•
'' HaSaii Kaptan cannot anymore be regarded as a child painter. -_A never failing sense of colour, balance and composition has always distinguished j his work/ 'I
have already admitted that there was Xd-ibb^bdry fOr Mfcbl 4ftd for Art. Yet, probably1 because these elements, -the elements of colour, balance’ * and compqsitioji - are limited .with the laws .of physics and geometry, Haaan, had already reached ' pbe limit in these respects.. .... ...	_. . ’		
      He has been advancing as a creative artist, on the strong foundation that his innate power df* ballaribe11 ahd composition and of colour harrhohy Had’ set up.
1 Apart from the subject of human beeings" which over dominated his ‘ earlier works, Hasan seems now to have developed an interest for - interiors and sea scapes as Well.
’ Someone asked him why he had painted the sea in' pink, in one of his seascapes. And Hasan replied: “I do not have to paint, it' in blue, just because God did j so!” A mbre candid explanation could hot be given of the artist’s relation with nature. Both God and the artist are creators. The difference between them fs that the artist borrows " from ;God the basic elements - of the Universe, and, with them, creates a: universe of his owiV Colours, and the ^Ojpp^r	rbtiid t .tip?

elements of the universe the capital “TJ”. They are the elem'ehts that the artist borrows. The pink as- well as the blue, among them. In-"’replacing the blue with- the pinky" the artist does nothing more than exercising -the right recognised - to him by- the;-Universe." •- ‘ Hasan has' alwayb gbven the "greatest' place in his canvasses, to human beiiigs; in that he has gone " farther'	ttiati any dtiier
Turkish artist. When he was only aix- or sbveh years old- he would scold, In "Hs polite way, older painters of reputation -whom he kneWy for -not dealing with the 'subject 7of-Man in all- their Works.
• - ’ Hutiiait beings, in Hasan’s recent-works, are passing through a transition period smilar to that between the arts of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance: They arfe becoming more alive and
