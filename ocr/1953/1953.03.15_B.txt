Turks Pitch Their Culture in the Heart Of Paris

President Vincent Auriol of Prance, was among	the first viewers of the Turkish Exhibition of Decorative Arts currently takink place at the Marsan galleries in the Louvers, Paris. Containing priceless specimens of Turkish craftmanship dating from the 12th to the 19th centuries, the exhibit is the first to give a comprehensive idea of Turkish culture about which so little is known outside Turkey. In view of this ignorance of Turkish civilization, one French commentator came forth with the statement that the Turks had pitched their tent of culture in the heart of Paris - a center of civilization itself.

The sword of Mehmet, the conqueror of Istanbul, viewed for the first time by the public, was among the treasures that attracted most attenion. The sword has special significance in view of the impending 500th anniversary of Istanbul - In 1953.

The costumes, originally worn by Suleiman the Magnificent, were also singled out for the beauty of their design and the quality of their material. The priceless crystals of Beykoz, very few of which remain, were handsome representations of Turkish craftmanship in the 18th century when the Ottoman Empire provided Europe with its best silks, brocades as well as crystals. It was the Industrial Revolution, with its mass production and lowering costs, that brought about the obliteration of Turkish industries.

The works of the Turkish 18th century painter Levni caused a great sensation. Very little was known about this artist for painting in Ottoman Turkey was a “secret” art. French critics wondered at the modernity of Levni's color schemes and techniques.

“Turks have many conquests to boast of,” commented a French writer, “therefore they did not bother to extoll their civilization to the oustide world. Today they are making new conquests such as in this art exhibit.”

TURKISH BRIGADE IN KOREA HAS UNIQUE COOK

WITH the TURKISH BRIGADE IN KOREA,

Can you imagine anyone entering a contest to come to the Korean battlefront?

The Turkish Brigade has one such person. He is Şemsettin Özbilen who had to win a contest of culinary art over a dozen other cooks in order to join the Turkish troops.

Özbilen is the cook for the officer’s mess at brigade headquarters and as the only civilian in the unit is the target of many Turkish puns. Already he is stamped with the reputation of being the brigade’s biggest "casualty" inflictor.

However Özbilen receives the joking from the hard fighting men in good-natured manner.

TEXT OF EDITORIAL ON DALLAS’ "TURKEY WEEK’

SIMILARITY BETWEEN TEXAS AND TURKEY - McGHEE A TEXAN

DALLAS, — Dallas’ Republic of Turkey Week which ended here Saturday night after many celebrations honoring the Turkish Republic, received high praise from the DALLAS TIMES - HERALD.

“The observance of ‘Republic of Turkey Week’ in Dallas has been remarkable enjoyable and instructive for all participants. The council on world affairs, sponsor of the week's activities, merits congratulations.

“No other nation has made more progress in the last 30 years than Turkey, and fortunately, the revolutionary change that Turkey has experienced has been peaceful rather than violent. Within an astonishingly short period Turkey has changed from a stagnant absolute monarchy to one of the most progressive and democratic republics in the world. This is a striking tribute to her 21 million people.

“Nuri Eren, director of the Turkish Information Office, who spent the week in Dallas, along with his wife and his assistant, Nezih Manyas, and his wife and daughter, frequently spoke of the similarity between his country and Texas. And it is true that this state and Turkey are much alike in physical georgraphy and in the spirit of the people. It is appropriate that the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey is George MsGhee, a Texan.
