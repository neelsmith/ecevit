    The subject of children’s pairi-
ting has recently been taken
into harid under a new light by
educatiönalists, psycholögists and
aestheticians, allmost everywhere
Ýn the World, and the' art educâ-
tion of children iýi comparatively
Progressive schools has been given
a new direction. The results of
this new impetus show certain
common characteristics in chil-
dren’s painting. :	: :;r ^
    Yet these characteristics Cannot
be found ih Haþan Kaptan’s work.
Som e of them might have existed
in his earlier paintings, but now,

that the artist borrows. The pink
as well as the blue, among them.
In: replacing the blue with the
pink, the artist does nothing more
thati exereising the right recogni-

    Haþan has alvvays given the
greatest' pîade iri his carivasies,
to human beings; in that he has

Turkish artist. When he was only
six or seven years old; he would

painters of reputation whom he
knew, for not dealing with the
subject of Man in ali their works.
    Human beings, in Hasan’s re-
cerit works, are passing through
a transition perlod smilar to that
between the arts of the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance: They
are becoming more alive and

   ; Haþan has also tricks with eyes: - He has painted a woman juggler with two pairs of eyes; and her child looks up with One eye, and looks down with the other.
   A visitor to the exhibition as- ked Haþan: “Why are these eyes so unusual?” and he ansvvered: “Well, they are jugglers; you can expect-anything from them!”
